# swiftbackmeup

An utility that allows one to create database backups and upload them to
OpenStack Swift

## Goal

The goal of `swiftbackmeup` is to be able to backup databases and upload
those backups to Swift (OpenStack Object Store).

`swiftbackmeup` is configuration driven. Every database that needs to be
backed up are described in the configuration file


## How to run it

The most simple way to run `swiftbackmeup`:

```
#> swiftbackmeup
```

This is equivalent to `swiftbackmeup --mode now`, it will look at the
configuration file located at `/etc/swiftbackmeup.conf`.


If one wants to trigger another mode:

```
#> swiftbackmeup --mode daily
#>
#> swiftbackmeup --mode monthly
```

## Modes

Modes are equivalent to tag the backup needs to be subscribed to.

So within the configuration file, backups are 'subscribed' to tags;

```
backups:
  - database: mydatabasenumberone
    subscriptions:
      - daily
      - monthly
      - now
      - tag1
      - mydatabasenumberone
```

This means that this backup will run only if `swiftbackmeup` is run with one
of the tags lists in subscriptions

Modes are defined in the configuration file, by default 4 modes come predefined.

  * `daily`: If one wants to backup the database on a daily basis, with a default of 7 day of retention
  * `weekly`: If one wants to backup the database on a weekly basis, with a default of 4 weeks of retention
  * `monthly`: If one wants to backup the database on a monthly basis, with a default of 6 months of retention
  * `now`: If one wants to backup the database at the moment t, with a default of 10 backup having the same name pattern.


Modes understand for now only two parameters:

  * `retention`: Number of days a backup should be kept, else purged.
  * `pattern`: Pattern that will be used in datetime.format later.


## Naming configuration

There are various way the filename of the backup can be specified.

  1. The backup is part of a tag with a matching pattern.


By default the name will be the pattern. But one can specify 2 parameters
`backup_filename_prefix` and `backup_filename_suffix` to actually have a
meaningfull name.

So name would be the equivalent of:

```
'%s%s%s' % (backup_filename_prefix, modes.pattern, backup_filename_suffix)
```

Example:

```
backups:
  - database: mydatabase
    subscriptions:
      - daily
    backup_filename_prefix: 'mydatabase_'
    backup_filename_suffix: '.dump.gz'
```

  2. The backup is part of a tag with a matching pattern (or not)


Whether the backup is part of a tag or not, one can override the final backup
filename by specifying `backup_filename`

```
backups:
  - database: mydatabase
    subscriptions:
      - daily
    backup_filename: 'mydatabase_backup.dump.gz'
```
